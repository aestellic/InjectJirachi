# InjectJirachi
Injects a legal randomized Wishmaker Jirachi into any mainline Generation III Save File. Intended for shiny hunting a legal Wishmaker Jirachi using custom distribution hardware (i.e. Raspberry Pi alongside GBxCart RW).

## Usage
`InjectJirachi <input.sav> <output.sav>`

Will output injected save to modified.sav in the current working directory.
You must have an open slot in your party; the program will exit if you do not.

## Notes
 - The seed used to generate the Jirachi is randomized, so standard Wishmaker RNG manipulation will not work.
 - Unlimited Jirachi's can be received per save
